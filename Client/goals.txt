Image comparison matching method
Minutiae matching using library
On-board fingerprint matching 
Encryption and decryption of files using fingerprint templates from sensor
    store templates in database?

    take image
    call image2tz
    call upchar
    read character file

    repeat and see if the files are the same
        they are not 

PROCESS idea 1:
1. user scans fingerprint
2. Fingerprint is stored in charbuffer1 on scanner
3. Python sequentially uploads a image from the database to the scanner charbuffer1
4. Match() is performed on the scanner
5. If there is a match then the character file from the database is used to generate the decryption key

PROCESS idea 2: -> Probs better idk because we don't have to do a ton of IO on the scanner (slow)
1. User scans fingerprint
2. Download fingerprint to computer
3. Fingerprint is uploaded to server along with selected match method
4. Match fingerprint on server against database using the selected method
    - How do we store the image files in the DB? 
        - base64?
    - Server is written in Java 
    - Server returns match/no match
    - If there is a match it also returns the decryption key
5. Python reads the result and if there's match reads the decryption key too
6. DRM protected software is decrypted
